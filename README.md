## Super Fantasy Queue

Every hero and every monster needs to take some time for grocery shopping at some point. Some troll's milk and spider cornflakes for the kids, oil for ye old armor or anew buckle for the +1 dexterity belt.

It is then that they have to make the most important decision of their lives - which line to stand in. 

Jump in and make your decision whether to *change* lines or stay put.

Includes 5 awesome levels + a surprise ending!
